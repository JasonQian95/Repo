/**
 * Running with Bunnies ====================
 * 
 * You and your rescued bunny prisoners need to get out of this collapsing death
 * trap of a space station - and fast! Unfortunately, some of the bunnies have
 * been weakened by their long imprisonment and can't run very fast. Their
 * friends are trying to help them, but this escape would go a lot faster if you
 * also pitched in. The defensive bulkhead doors have begun to close, and if you
 * don't make it through in time, you'll be trapped! You need to grab as many
 * bunnies as you can and get through the bulkheads before they close.
 * 
 * The time it takes to move from your starting point to all of the bunnies and
 * to the bulkhead will be given to you in a square matrix of integers. Each row
 * will tell you the time it takes to get to the start, first bunny, second
 * bunny, ..., last bunny, and the bulkhead in that order. The order of the rows
 * follows the same pattern (start, each bunny, bulkhead). The bunnies can jump
 * into your arms, so picking them up is instantaneous, and arriving at the
 * bulkhead at the same time as it seals still allows for a successful, if
 * dramatic, escape. (Don't worry, any bunnies you don't pick up will be able to
 * escape with you since they no longer have to carry the ones you did pick up.)
 * You can revisit different spots if you wish, and moving to the bulkhead
 * doesn't mean you have to immediately leave - you can move to and from the
 * bulkhead to pick up additional bunnies if time permits.
 * 
 * In addition to spending time traveling between bunnies, some paths interact
 * with the space station's security checkpoints and add time back to the clock.
 * Adding time to the clock will delay the closing of the bulkhead doors, and if
 * the time goes back up to 0 or a positive number after the doors have already
 * closed, it triggers the bulkhead to reopen. Therefore, it might be possible
 * to walk in a circle and keep gaining time: that is, each time a path is
 * traversed, the same amount of time is used or added.
 * 
 * Write a function of the form answer(times, time_limit) to calculate the most
 * bunnies you can pick up and which bunnies they are, while still escaping
 * through the bulkhead before the doors close for good. If there are multiple
 * sets of bunnies of the same size, return the set of bunnies with the lowest
 * prisoner IDs (as indexes) in sorted order. The bunnies are represented as a
 * sorted list by prisoner ID, with the first bunny being 0. There are at most 5
 * bunnies, and time_limit is a non-negative integer that is at most 999.
 * 
 * For instance, in the case of [ [0, 2, 2, 2, -1], # 0 = Start [9, 0, 2, 2,
 * -1], # 1 = Bunny 0 [9, 3, 0, 2, -1], # 2 = Bunny 1 [9, 3, 2, 0, -1], # 3 =
 * Bunny 2 [9, 3, 2, 2, 0], # 4 = Bulkhead ] and a time limit of 1, the five
 * inner array rows designate the starting point, bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2, and
 * the bulkhead door exit respectively. You could take the path:
 * 
 * Start End Delta Time Status - 0 - 1 Bulkhead initially open 0 4 -1 2 4 2 2 0
 * 2 4 -1 1 4 3 2 -1 Bulkhead closes 3 4 -1 0 Bulkhead reopens; you and the
 * bunnies exit
 * 
 * With this solution, you would pick up bunnies 1 and 2. This is the best
 * combination for this space station hallway, so the answer is [1, 2].
