 CODE EXPLANATION:
 ext2_cp has a segfault
 
 ext2_mkdir 
	Pro:
	- Implemented features for finding a free block and a free node for the directory
	- Initiated node with correct values
	- Initiated directory entry with correct values and made sure size is 4B aligned
	- Found an location in the parent directory to store the new directory to be created
	- Placed the new directory in its correct location and made the necessary adjustments regarding the size of the affected directory entries
	- Handled single indirection when looking for a location to store the new directory
	- Created “.” and “..” directory entries and placed it within the data block for the new directory entry 
	
	Con:
	- It doesn’t work because it has an infinite loop that stems from rec_len being 0 when we read it from directory entry
	
 ext2_cp
	Pro:
	- Able to do what was mentioned in ext2_mkdir plus copying data into free blocks on the img file
	
	Con:
	- ext2_cp has a segfault that most likely stems from the same infinite loop code which we reused from ext2_mkdir.
