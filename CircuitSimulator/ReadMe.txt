How to Use the Simulator:

The starting component selected will be the pointer. You can tell that this component is selected by the yellow highlight over the component's image. In order to select a different component, merely click on the component's image and click on the screen in order to place that component. If you misplaced a component, do not fear as you can drag this component around the screen with the pointer.


************************************************************  Components  *************************************************************************
   
Battery
You may only have 1 battery on the screen at once. 

Lightbulb
Lightbulbs will automatically light up if the circuit is completed. The resistance for lightbulbs is 0 Ohms. 

Resistor
These components have a default resistance of 10 Ohms. You can have any number of these on the screen as you like.

Wiring
Wiring with this program is a simple process. SImply make sure that you have the wire component selected, then click on one node of a component and drag the mouse to the desired ending node of a different component. An wire will be shown as you drag so you know where you are dragging to. If the wire does not connect, then it will cancel and you have to re-draw it.  

Pointer
This is your main tool for changing and observing values. Make sure that the pointer is selected, and click on a component to view it's values such as voltage, current and resistance. To drag a component, click and drag the component to the desired position. 


Once your circuit is complete, make sure you click the "click to show surface charge" button! This will show the surface charge density on all of the wires, and the wires will be colorcoded as well. Red is for positive and green is for negative. The less the surface charge density value is, the wires will become darker and darker shades of their corresponding color. 

************************************************************  Menu Options  ***********************************************************************

New Simulator
Pressing this or by pressing CTRL+N will create a new empty simulator.

Circuit One
Under premade circuits, you can select this option in order to create a premade circuit with 1 battery and 2 resistors connected in series.
